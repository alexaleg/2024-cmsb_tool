Dynamical models of biochemical systems help unravel mechanisms describing the behavior of living organisms and make predictions under unseen circumstances.
Realistic models need to be built with enough detail to capture all the subtleties and factors involved in the description of the biological model of interest.
This requires the use of large state spaces which are not amenable for human intelligibility or computational study.
Model reduction is a set of techniques that provides the modeler with a lower-dimensional system, while preserving properties of interest of the original system.
In the context of system biology, it is key to preserve physical interpretability as these models validate mechanistic insights~\cite{10.1093/bioinformatics/btn035,21899762,Apri201216}.

%There is a plethora of reduction methods to carry out model reduction based on different approaches such as time-scale separation properties~\cite{okino1998,DBLP:journals/tac/WhitbyCKLTT22}, quasi-steady-state approximation~\cite{SegelS89,radulescu2012reduction}, heuristic fitness functions~\cite{10.1145/3071178.3071265}, spatial regularity~\cite{DBLP:journals/pe/TschaikowskiT17}, sensitivity analysis~\cite{Snowden:2017aa} and, at last, conservation analysis, which detects linear combinations of variables that are constant at all times~\cite{10.1093/bioinformatics/bti800}.

Lumping is set of model reduction techniques that outputs a self-consistent system of dynamical equations comprised of a set of macro-variables, each given in terms of combination of the original ones~\cite{okino1998,Snowden:2017aa,DBLP:conf/qest/GrossmannKBW18,backenkohler2021abstraction,DBLP:journals/pe/AbateACK21}.
In linear lumping, this reduction is expressed as a linear transformation of the original state variables.
Since this can destroy physical intelligibility in general, \emph{constrained lumping} allows restricting to only part of the state by defining linear combinations of state variables that ought to be preserved in the reduction~\cite{LI199195}.


CLUE has been presented as an algorithm that efficiently computes constrained linear lumpings~\cite{ovchinnikov_clue_2021}.
It avoids the computational shortcomings of previous work due to the symbolic computation of the eigenvalues of a nonconstant matrix~\cite{LiRabitz,LI199195}, thus enabling the analysis of models with several thousands of equations on standard hardware.
In particular, CLUE can compute \emph{the smallest} linear dimensional reduction that preserves the dynamics of arbitrary linear combinations of original state variables given by the user.
While it is possible to extend CLUE to rational systems~\cite{jimenez_clue_2022} by means of symbolic computations, this approach quickly becomes computationally expensive.
This problem can be avoided by efficiently creating a representation of the dynamics by sampling it at different points using automatic differentiation~\cite{jimenez_clue_2022}.


In this paper, we introduce \ToolName adding new features to the existing package CLUE \cite{ovchinnikov_clue_2021,jimenez_clue_2022}.
We extend this package to add functionality for approximate reductions.
These are reductions that have more aggregating power at the expense of a bounded error\cite{leguizamon-robayo_approximate_2023}. 
Moreover, we add functionality to get models from common repositories such as OdeBase\cite{}. 
As well as simulation support for exploratory analysis.
The tool can be installed via \texttt{pip} with the following command

\begin{minted}{bash}
  $ pip install git+\RepoURL
\end{minted}




%There is a variety of approaches in this context, such as those exploiting time-scale separation properties~\cite{okino1998,DBLP:journals/tac/WhitbyCKLTT22}, quasi-steady-state approximation~\cite{SegelS89,radulescu2012reduction}, heuristic fitness functions~\cite{10.1145/3071178.3071265}, spatial regularity~\cite{DBLP:journals/pe/TschaikowskiT17}, sensitivity analysis~\cite{Snowden:2017aa} and, at last, conservation analysis, which detects linear combinations of variables that are constant at all times~\cite{10.1093/bioinformatics/bti800}.
%In applications to systems biology, it is beneficial that the reduced state space keeps physical interpretability, mainly when the model is used to validate mechanistic hypotheses.


%Realistic and accurate models, however, often require considerable detail that inevitably leads to large state spaces.
%This hinders both human intelligibility and numerical/computational analysis.
%For example, even the relatively primary mechanism of protein phosphorylation yields, in the worst case, a combinatorial state space as a function of the number of phosphorylation sites~\cite{FEBS:FEBS7027}.

%There is a variety of approaches in this context, such as those exploiting time-scale separation properties~\cite{okino1998,DBLP:journals/tac/WhitbyCKLTT22}, quasi-steady-state approximation~\cite{SegelS89,radulescu2012reduction}, heuristic fitness functions~\cite{10.1145/3071178.3071265}, spatial regularity~\cite{DBLP:journals/pe/TschaikowskiT17}, sensitivity analysis~\cite{Snowden:2017aa} and, at last, conservation analysis, which detects linear combinations of variables that are constant at all times~\cite{10.1093/bioinformatics/bti800}.


%These include the exact reduction of rational systems \cite{jimenez_clue_2022}, the 

%By lumping, one generally refers to the latter class, with a self-consistent system of dynamical equations comprised of a set of macro-variables, each given in terms of combination of the original ones~\cite{okino1998,Snowden:2017aa,DBLP:conf/qest/GrossmannKBW18,backenkohler2021abstraction,DBLP:journals/pe/AbateACK21}.

%Since this can destroy physical intelligibility in general, \emph{constrained lumping} allows restricting to only part of the state by defining linear combinations of state variables that ought to be preserved in the reduction~\cite{LI199195}.

%Lumping techniques of Markov chains date back to the early nineties~\cite{Larsen19911}.
%These were later extended to stochastic process algebra~\cite{10.1007/978-0-387-09680-3_18,10.1007/978-3-540-88479-8_13,10.1093/comjnl/bxr094,DBLP:conf/splc/Tribastone14,TSCHAIKOWSKI2014140}, and have been expanded more recently to efficient algorithmic approaches for stochastic chemical reaction networks~\cite{DBLP:journals/bioinformatics/CardelliPTTVW21} and deterministic models of biological systems~\cite{CARDELLI2019132,pnas17,DBLP:conf/lics/CardelliTTV16}.
%In these works, reduction mappings are linear mappings induced by a partition (i.e., an equivalence relation) of state variables; in the aggregated system each macro-variable represents the sum of the original variables of a partition block.

%In this paper we are concerned with systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with analytical derivatives.

	%As concrete instances, we mention systems with \textit{rational} and \textit{polynomial} derivatives which cover kinetic models with Hill~\cite{voit_biochemical_2013}, Michaelis-Menten~\cite{voit_biochemical_2013} and mass-action semantics (e.g.,~\cite{Voit:2013aa,DBLP:journals/biosystems/TrojakSPB23});

%The aforementioned lumping approaches are \emph{exact}, in that the reduced model does not incur any approximation error (but only loss of information because, in general, the aggregation map is not invertible).
%Approximate lumping is a natural extension that has been studied for a long time (e.g.,~\cite{LI1990977}).
%Indeed, although exact reduction methods have been experimentally proved successful in a large variety of biological systems (e.g.,~\cite{SBML}), approximate reductions can be more robust to parametric uncertainty---which notoriously affects systems biology models (e.g.,~\cite{doi:10.1098/rsif.2017.0237,DBLP:conf/cmsb/BarnatBBDHPS17})---and offer a flexible trade-off between the aggressiveness of the reduction and its precision.
%For partition-based lumping algorithms, this has been recently explored.
%In~\cite{DBLP:conf/qest/CardelliTTV18}, the authors present an algorithm for approximate aggregation parameterized by a tolerance $\varepsilon$, which, informally, relaxes an underlying criterion of equality for two variables to be exactly lumped into the same block.
%Similarly, for linear lumpings, an approximate extension to CLUE for polynomial systems has been presented in~\cite{leguizamon-robayo_approximate_2023}.
%This approach relaxes the conditions for exact lumping using a \emph{lumping tolerance} parameter that is roughly related to how close a lumping matrix is to an exact lumping.
%In particular, the authors show that the actual error is proportional to the lumping tolerance.

	%%In this paper, we extend approximate constrained lumping~\cite{leguizamon-robayo_approximate_2023} to systems of ODEs with general analytical drifts including rational drifts, while still working in polynomial time.
	%%Using a prototype implementation, we evaluate our approach on five polynomial models and four rational models representative of the literature.
	%%We also propose a new way to compute an approximate lumping tolerance based on the expected size of the reduced model.
	%%Overall, the numerical results recover previous ones~\cite{leguizamon-robayo_approximate_2023} and show that our extension can lead to substantially smaller reduced models while introducing limited errors in the dynamics both for polynomial and rational systems.
	%%In light of these results, we propose a heuristic that provides one with a value to determine a lumping tolerance that outputs a reduction with an acceptable error.

%%\paragraph{\textbf{Further related work.}} We are complementary to classic works~\cite{LI1990977,LI199195} which do not address the efficient algorithmic computation of lumping. Moreover, we are more general than~\cite{iacobelli_lumpability_2013,tac15,DBLP:conf/qest/CardelliTTV18} which consider so-called ``proper'' lumping (i.e.,~\cite{Snowden:2017aa}) where each state variable appears in exactly one aggregated variable. %The algorithm takes as input a numerical tolerance and computes an approximate constrained lumping whose error is guaranteed to be proportional to the lumping tolerance. %The estimation rests upon Gronwall's inequality that has been used in~\cite{}.
%%Likewise, we are complementary to rule-based reduction techniques~\cite{Feret21042009} which are independent of kinetic parameters~\cite{concur15}. As less closely related abstraction techniques, we mention (bisimulation) distance approaches for the approximate reduction of Markov chains~\cite{DBLP:conf/tacas/BacciBLM13,DBLP:conf/concur/DacaHKP16} and proper orthogonal projection~\cite{antoulas}, which, however, apply to linear systems. Abstraction of chemical reaction networks by means of learning~\cite{DBLP:journals/iandc/RepinP21,DBLP:conf/cmsb/CairoliCB21} and simulation~\cite{DBLP:conf/cmsb/HelfrichCKM22} are complementary to lumping methods.
