In life sciences, deriving insights from dynamical systems can be challenging due to the large number of state variables involved. 
To address this, model reduction techniques can be used to project the system onto a lower-dimensional state space.
CLUE is a tool that computes exact reductions for rational systems of ordinary differential equations.
In this paper, we present an extension of CLUE to include approximate reductions which allow for larger aggregating power at the expense of a bounded error.
Additionally, our extension includes new functionalities such as an interface to the model database OdeBase repository and simulation techniques for exploratory analyses.
