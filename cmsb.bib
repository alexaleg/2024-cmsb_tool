	abstract = {A general analysis of approximate lumping is presented. This analysis can be applied to any reaction system with n species described by dy/dt =f(y), where y is an n-dimensional vector in a desired region Ω, and f(y) is an arbitrary n-dimensional function vector. Here we consider lumping by means of a rectangular constant matrix M (i.e. {\^y} = My, where M is a row-full rank matrix and {\^y} has dimension n̂ not larger than n). The observer theory initiated by Luenberger is formally employed to obtain the kinetic equations and discuss the properties of the approximately lumped system. The approximately lumped kinetic equations have the same form d{\^y}/dt = Mf/My) as that for exactly lumped ones, but depend on the choice of the generalized inverse M of M. {1,2,3,4}-inverse is a good choice of the generalized inverse of M. The equations to determine the approximate lumping matrices M are presented. These equations can be solved by iteration. An approach for choosing suitable initial iteration values of the equations is illustrated by examples.},

	abstract = {<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Janus kinases (Jaks) interact with and activate receptors on the cell surface that mediate changes in gene expression. How these interactions are promoted and regulated is of central interest in fields such as cellular endocrinology and immunology. Here, detailed computational models of Jak activation are offered at the level of protein modification states and interaction domains, wherein the specification of only a handful of binding/reaction rules can produce networks comprised of thousands of differential equations. Specifically, we investigated the role of an adaptor protein, SH2-B, revealing a novel mechanism whereby it cooperates with receptors to form a stable complex that juxtaposes two Jak molecules for efficient activation. We refer to this mode of molecular assembly as the bipolar clamp mechanism.</p>

	abstract = { Dynamical systems describing whole cells are on the verge of becoming a reality. But as models of reality, they are only useful if we have realistic parameters for the molecular reaction rates and cell physiological processes. There is currently no suitable framework to reliably estimate hundreds, let alone thousands, of reaction rate parameters. Here, we map out the relative weaknesses and promises of different approaches aimed at redressing this issue. While suitable procedures for estimation or inference of the whole (vast) set of parameters will, in all likelihood, remain elusive, some hope can be drawn from the fact that much of the cellular behaviour may be explained in terms of smaller sets of parameters. Identifying such parameter sets and assessing their behaviour is now becoming possible even for very large systems of equations, and we expect such methods to become central tools in the development and analysis of whole-cell models. },

	abstract = {The complexity of full-scale metabolic models is a major obstacle for their effective use in computational systems biology. The aim of model reduction is to circumvent this problem by eliminating parts of a model that are unimportant for the properties of interest. The choice of reduction method is influenced both by the type of model complexity and by the objective of the reduction; therefore, no single method is superior in all cases. In this study we present a comparative study of two different methods applied to a 20D model of yeast glycolytic oscillations. Our objective is to obtain biochemically meaningful reduced models, which reproduce the dynamic properties of the 20D model. The first method uses lumping and subsequent constrained parameter optimization. The second method is a novel approach that eliminates variables not essential for the dynamics. The applications of the two methods result in models of eight (lumping), six (elimination) and three (lumping followed by elimination) dimensions. All models have similar dynamic properties and pin-point the same interactions as being crucial for generation of the oscillations. The advantage of the novel method is that it is algorithmic, and does not require input in the form of biochemical knowledge. The lumping approach, however, is better at preserving biochemical properties, as we show through extensive analyses of the models.},

	abstract = {After activation, many receptors and their adaptor proteins act as scaffolds displaying numerous docking sites and engaging multiple targets. The consequent assemblage of a variety of protein complexes results in a combinatorial increase in the number of feasible molecular species presenting different states of a receptor-scaffold signaling module. Tens of thousands of such microstates emerge even for the initial signal propagation events, greatly impeding a quantitative analysis of networks. Here, we demonstrate that the assumption of independence of molecular events occurring at distinct sites enables us to approximate a mechanistic picture of all possible microstates by a macrodescription of states of separate domains, i.e., macrostates that correspond to experimentally verifiable variables. This analysis dissects a highly branched network into interacting pathways originated by protein complexes assembled on different sites of receptors and scaffolds. We specify when the temporal dynamics of any given microstate can be expressed using the product of the relative concentrations of individual sites. The methods presented here are equally applicable to deterministic and stochastic calculations of the temporal dynamics. Our domain-oriented approach drastically reduces the number of states, processes, and kinetic parameters to be considered for quantification of complex signaling networks that propagate distinct physiological responses. },

	abstract = {Modelers of molecular signaling networks must cope with the combinatorial explosion of protein states generated by posttranslational modifications and complex formation. Rule-based models provide a powerful alternative to approaches that require explicit enumeration of all possible molecular species of a system. Such models consist of formal rules stipulating the (partial) contexts wherein specific protein--protein interactions occur. These contexts specify molecular patterns that are usually less detailed than molecular species. Yet, the execution of rule-based dynamics requires stochastic simulation, which can be very costly. It thus appears desirable to convert a rule-based model into a reduced system of differential equations by exploiting the granularity at which rules specify interactions. We present a formal (and automated) method for constructing a coarse-grained and self-consistent dynamical system aimed at molecular patterns that are distinguishable by the dynamics of the original system as posited by the rules. The method is formally sound and never requires the execution of the rule-based model. The coarse-grained variables do not depend on the values of the rate constants appearing in the rules, and typically form a system of greatly reduced dimension that can be amenable to numerical integration and further model reduction techniques.},

@article{Gunawardena11102005,
	abstract = {Phosphorylation and dephosphorylation play a fundamental role in eukaryotic signaling. Some 30% of proteins are phosphorylated at any time, many on multiple sites, raising the question of how the cellular phosphorylation state is regulated. Previous work for one and two phosphorylation sites has revealed mechanisms, such as distributive phosphorylation, for switch-like regulation of maximally phosphorylated phosphoforms. These insights have led to the influential view that more phosphorylation sites leads to steeper switching, as proposed for substrates like cyclin E and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Sic1. An analytical study of the ordered distributive case reveals a more complex story. Multisite phosphorylation creates an efficient threshold: The proportion of maximally phosphorylated substrate is maintained close to 0 when the ratio of kinase to phosphatase activity lies below a suitable threshold, and this threshold increases with increasing numbers of sites, n. However, above the threshold, the response may not always abruptly switch between 0 and 1, as would be the case for an efficient switch, but may increase in a gradual manner, which becomes more hyperbolic with increasing n. Abrupt switching cannot be attributed merely to n being large. We point out that conventional measures of ultrasensitivity must be modified to discriminate between thresholding and switching; we discuss additional factors that influence switching efficiency and suggest new directions for experimental investigation.},

	abstract = {{Motivation: Large biochemical networks pose a unique challenge from the point of view of evaluating conservation laws. The computational problem in most cases exceeds the capability of available software tools, often resulting in inaccurate computation of the number and form of conserved cycles. Such errors have profound effects on subsequent calculations, particularly in the evaluation of the Jacobian which is a critical quantity in many other calculations. The goal of this paper is to outline a new algorithm that is computationally efficient and robust at extracting the correct conservation laws for very large biochemical networks.Results: We show that our algorithm can perform the conservation analysis of large biochemical networks, and can evaluate the correct conserved cycles when compared with other similar software tools. Biochemical simulators such as Jarnac and COPASI are successful at extracting only a subset of the conservation laws that our algorithm can. This is illustrated with examples for some large networks which show the advantages of our method.Availability: The software is available as part of the latest release of Systems Biology Workbench (SBW version 2.5.0) and can be downloaded from .

	abstract = {Large-scale dynamical models hinder our capability of effectively analyzing them and interpreting their behavior. We present an algorithm for the simplification of polynomial ordinary differential equations by aggregating their variables. The reduction can preserve observables of interest and yields a physically intelligible reduced model, since each aggregate corresponds to the exact sum of original variables.Ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with polynomial derivatives are a fundamental tool for understanding the dynamics of systems across many branches of science, but our ability to gain mechanistic insight and effectively conduct numerical evaluations is critically hindered when dealing with large models. Here we propose an aggregation technique that rests on two notions of equivalence relating ODE variables whenever they have the same solution (backward criterion) or if a self-consistent system can be written for describing the evolution of sums of variables in the same equivalence class (forward criterion). A key feature of our proposal is to encode a polynomial ODE system into a finitary structure akin to a formal chemical reaction network. This enables the development of a discrete algorithm to efficiently compute the largest equivalence, building on approaches rooted in computer science to minimize basic models of computation through iterative partition refinements. The physical interpretability of the aggregation is shown on polynomial ODE systems for biochemical reaction networks, gene regulatory networks, and evolutionary game theory.},

	abstract = {Two new approaches to the determination of constrained lumping schemes are presented. They are based on the property that the lumping schemes validated in the whole composition Yn-space of y are only determined by the invariance of the subspace spanned by the row vectors of lumping matrix M with respect to the transpose of the Jacobian matrix JT(y) for the kinetic equations. It is proved that, when a part of a lumping matrix MG is given, each row of the part of the lumping matrix to be determined, MD, is certain linear combinations of a set of eigenvectors of a special symmetric matrix. This symmetric matrix is related to MTG and AkMTG, where Ak are the basis matrices of JT (y). It is shown that the approximate lumping matrices containing MG with different row number n̂(n̂ <n) and global minimum errors can be determined by an optimization method. Using the concept of the minimal invariant subspace of a constant matrix over a given subspace one can directly obtain the lumping matrices containing MG with different n̂. The accuracy of these lumping matrices are shown to be satisfactory in sample calculations.},

	abstract = {Complex models of biochemical reaction systems have become increasingly common in the systems biology literature. The complexity of such models can present a number of obstacles for their practical use, often making problems difficult to intuit or computationally intractable. Methods of model reduction can be employed to alleviate the issue of complexity by seeking to eliminate those portions of a reaction network that have little or no effect upon the outcomes of interest, hence yielding simplified systems that retain an accurate predictive capacity. This review paper seeks to provide a brief overview of a range of such methods and their application in the context of biochemical reaction network models. To achieve this, we provide a brief mathematical account of the main methods including timescale exploitation approaches, reduction via sensitivity analysis, optimisation methods, lumping, and singular value decomposition-based approaches. Methods are reviewed in the context of large-scale systems biology type models, and future areas of research are briefly discussed.},

	abstract = {{Motivation: The current trend in dynamical modelling of biochemical systems is to construct more and more mechanistically detailed and thus complex models. The complexity is reflected in the number of dynamic state variables and parameters, as well as in the complexity of the kinetic rate expressions. However, a greater level of complexity, or level of detail, does not necessarily imply better models, or a better understanding of the underlying processes. Data often does not contain enough information to discriminate between different model hypotheses, and such overparameterization makes it hard to establish the validity of the various parts of the model. Consequently, there is an increasing demand for model reduction methods.Results: We present a new reduction method that reduces complex rational rate expressions, such as those often used to describe enzymatic reactions. The method is a novel term-based identifiability analysis, which is easy to use and allows for user-specified reductions of individual rate expressions in complete models. The method is one of the first methods to meet the classical engineering objective of improved parameter identifiability without losing the systems biology demand of preserved biochemical interpretation.Availability: The method has been implemented in the Systems Biology Toolbox 2 for MATLAB, which is freely available from http://www.sbtoolbox2.org. The Supplementary Material contains scripts that show how to use it by applying the method to the example models, discussed in this article.Contact:henning.schmidt@uni-rostock.deSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}},

@article{21899762,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND:Models of biochemical systems are typically complex, which may complicate the discovery of cardinal biochemical principles. It is therefore important to single out the parts of a model that are essential for the function of the system, so that the remaining non-essential parts can be eliminated. However, each component of a mechanistic model has a clear biochemical interpretation, and it is desirable to conserve as much of this interpretability as possible in the reduction process. Furthermore, it is of great advantage if we can translate predictions from the reduced model to the original model.RESULTS:In this paper we present a novel method for model reduction that generates reduced models with a clear biochemical interpretation. Unlike conventional methods for model reduction our method enables the mapping of predictions by the reduced model to the corresponding detailed predictions by the original model. The method is based on proper lumping of state variables interacting on short time scales and on the computation of fraction parameters, which serve as the link between the reduced model and the original model. We illustrate the advantages of the proposed method by applying it to two biochemical models. The first model is of modest size and is commonly occurring as a part of larger models. The second model describes glucose transport across the cell membrane in baker's yeast. Both models can be significantly reduced with the proposed method, at the same time as the interpretability is conserved.CONCLUSIONS:We introduce a novel method for reduction of biochemical models that is compatible with the concept of zooming. Zooming allows the modeler to work on different levels of model granularity, and enables a direct interpretation of how modifications to the model on one level affect the model on other levels in the hierarchy. The method extends the applicability of the method that was previously developed for zooming of linear biochemical models to nonlinear models.},

	abstract = {Detailed mechanistic models of biological processes can pose significant challenges for analysis and parameter estimations due to the large number of equations used to track the dynamics of all distinct configurations in which each involved biochemical species can be found. Model reduction can help tame such complexity by providing a lower-dimensional model in which each macro-variable can be directly related to the original variables.We present CLUE, an algorithm for exact model reduction of systems of polynomial differential equations by constrained linear lumping. It computes the smallest dimensional reduction as a linear mapping of the state space such that the reduced model preserves the dynamics of user-specified linear combinations of the original variables. Even though CLUE works with non-linear differential equations, it is based on linear algebra tools, which makes it applicable to high-dimensional models. Using case studies from the literature, we show how CLUE can substantially lower model dimensionality and help extract biologically intelligible insights from the reduction.An implementation of the algorithm and relevant resources to replicate the experiments herein reported are freely available for download at https://github.com/pogudingleb/CLUE.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

ERODE supports two recently introduced, complementary, equivalence relations over ODE variables: forward differential equivalence yields a self-consistent aggregate system where each ODE gives the cumulative dynamics of the sum of the original variables in the respective equivalence class. Backward differential equivalence identifies variables that have identical solutions whenever starting from the same initial conditions. As back-end ERODE uses the well-known Z3 SMT solver to compute the largest equivalence that refines a given initial partition of ODE variables. In the special case of ODEs with polynomial derivatives of degree at most two (covering affine systems and elementary chemical reaction networks), it implements a more efficient partition-refinement algorithm in the style of Paige and Tarjan. ERODE comes with a rich development environment based on the Eclipse plug-in framework offering: (i) seamless project management; (ii) a fully-featured text editor; and (iii) importing-exporting capabilities.},

	abstract = {Fluid models have gained popularity in the performance modeling of computing systems and communication networks. When the model under study consists of many different types of agents, the size of the associated system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) increases with the number of types, making the analysis more difficult. We study this problem for a class of models where heterogeneity is expressed as a perturbation of certain parameters of the ODE vector field. We provide an a-priori bound that relates the solutions of the original, heterogenous model with that of an ODE system of smaller size which arises from aggregating system variables concerning different types of agents. By showing that this bound grows linearly with the intensity of the perturbation, we provide a formal justification to the intuitive possibility of neglecting small differences in agents' behavior as a means to reducing the dimensionality of the original system.},

@article{donovan_unbiased_2016,
	abstract = {The long-term goal of connecting scales in biological simulation can be facilitated by scale-agnostic methods. We demonstrate that the weighted ensemble (WE) strategy, initially developed for molecular simulations, applies effectively to spatially resolved cell-scale simulations. The WE approach runs an ensemble of parallel trajectories with assigned weights and uses a statistical resampling strategy of replicating and pruning trajectories to focus computational effort on difficult-to-sample regions. The method can also generate unbiased estimates of non-equilibrium and equilibrium observables, sometimes with significantly less aggregate computing time than would be possible using standard parallelization. Here, we use WE to orchestrate particle-based kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, which include spatial geometry (e.g., of organelles, plasma membrane) and biochemical interactions among mobile molecular species. We study a series of models exhibiting spatial, temporal and biochemical complexity and show that although WE has important limitations, it can achieve performance significantly exceeding standard parallel simulation---by orders of magnitude for some observables.},

@article{hogg_exact_2014,
	abstract = {Detailed modeling and simulation of biochemical systems is complicated by the problem of combinatorial complexity, an explosion in the number of species and reactions due to myriad protein-protein interactions and post-translational modifications. Rule-based modeling overcomes this problem by representing molecules as structured objects and encoding their interactions as pattern-based rules. This greatly simplifies the process of model specification, avoiding the tedious and error prone task of manually enumerating all species and reactions that can potentially exist in a system. From a simulation perspective, rule-based models can be expanded algorithmically into fully-enumerated reaction networks and simulated using a variety of network-based simulation methods, such as ordinary differential equations or Gillespie's algorithm, provided that the network is not exceedingly large. Alternatively, rule-based models can be simulated directly using particle-based kinetic Monte Carlo methods. This ``network-free'' approach produces exact stochastic trajectories with a computational cost that is independent of network size. However, memory and run time costs increase with the number of particles, limiting the size of system that can be feasibly simulated. Here, we present a hybrid particle/population simulation method that combines the best attributes of both the network-based and network-free approaches. The method takes as input a rule-based model and a user-specified subset of species to treat as population variables rather than as particles. The model is then transformed by a process of ``partial network expansion'' into a dynamically equivalent form that can be simulated using a population-adapted network-free simulator. The transformation method has been implemented within the open-source rule-based modeling platform BioNetGen, and resulting hybrid models can be simulated using the particle-based simulator NFsim. Performance tests show that significant memory savings can be achieved using the new approach and a monetary cost analysis provides a practical measure of its utility.},

@article{barua_bipolar_2009,
	abstract = {Most cell surface receptors for growth factors and cytokines dimerize in order to mediate signal transduction. For many such receptors, the Janus kinase (Jak) family of non-receptor protein tyrosine kinases are recruited in pairs and juxtaposed by dimerized receptor complexes in order to activate one another by trans-phosphorylation. An alternative mechanism for Jak trans-phosphorylation has been proposed in which the phosphorylated kinase interacts with the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain of SH2-B, a unique adaptor protein with the capacity to homo-dimerize. Building on a rule-based kinetic modeling approach that considers the concerted nature and combinatorial complexity of modular protein domain interactions, we examine these mechanisms in detail, focusing on the growth hormone (GH) receptor/Jak2/SH2-Bβ system. The modeling results suggest that, whereas Jak2-(SH2-Bβ)2-Jak2 heterotetramers are scarcely expected to affect Jak2 phosphorylation, SH2-Bβ and dimerized receptors synergistically promote Jak2 trans-activation in the context of intracellular signaling. Analysis of the results revealed a unique mechanism whereby SH2-B and receptor dimers constitute a bipolar `clamp' that stabilizes the active configuration of two Jak2 molecules in the same macro-complex.},

@article{borisov_domain-oriented_2008,
	abstract = {The coupling of membrane-bound receptors to transcriptional regulators and other effector functions is mediated by multi-domain proteins that form complex assemblies. The modularity of protein interactions lends itself to a rule-based description, in which species and reactions are generated by rules that encode the necessary context for an interaction to occur, but also can produce a combinatorial explosion in the number of chemical species that make up the signaling network. We have shown previously that exact network reduction can be achieved using hierarchical control relationships between sites/domains on proteins to dissect multi-domain proteins into sets of non-interacting sites, allowing the replacement of each ``full'' (progenitor) protein with a set of derived auxiliary (offspring) proteins. The description of a network in terms of auxiliary proteins that have fewer sites than progenitor proteins often greatly reduces network size. We describe here a method for automating domain-oriented model reduction and its implementation as a module in the BioNetGen modeling package. It takes as input a standard BioNetGen model and automatically performs the following steps: 1) detecting the hierarchical control relationships between sites; 2) building up the auxiliary proteins; 3) generating a raw reduced model; and 4) cleaning up the raw model to provide the correct mass balance for each chemical species in the reduced network. We tested the performance of this module on models representing portions of growth factor receptor and immunoreceptor-mediated signaling networks, and confirmed its ability to reduce the model size and simulation cost by at least one or two orders of magnitude. Limitations of the current algorithm include the inability to reduce models based on implicit site dependencies or heterodimerization, and loss of accuracy when dynamics are computed stochastically.},

@article{mu_carbon-fate_2007,
	abstract = {MOTIVATION: Stable isotope labeling of small-molecule metabolites (e.g. (13)C-labeling of glucose) is a powerful tool for characterizing pathways and reaction fluxes in a metabolic network. Analysis of isotope labeling patterns requires knowledge of the fates of individual atoms and moieties in reactions, which can be difficult to collect in a useful form when considering a large number of enzymatic reactions.
RESULTS: We report carbon-fate maps for 4605 enzyme-catalyzed reactions documented in the KEGG database. Every fate map has been manually checked for consistency with known reaction mechanisms. A map includes a standardized structure-based identifier for each reactant (namely, an InChI string); indices for carbon atoms that are uniquely derived from the metabolite identifiers; structural data, including an identification of homotopic and prochiral carbon atoms; and a bijective map relating the corresponding carbon atoms in substrates and products. Fate maps are defined using the BioNetGen language (BNGL), a formal model-specification language, which allows a set of maps to be automatically translated into isotopomer mass-balance equations.
AVAILABILITY: The carbon-fate maps and software for visualizing the maps are freely available (http://cellsignaling.lanl.gov/FateMaps/).},

@article{tomlin_effect_1997,
	abstract = {A frequently desirable characteristic of chemical kinetics systems is that of persistence, the property that if all the species are initially present, then none of them may tend toward extinction. It is known that solutions of deterministically modeled mass-action systems may approach only portions of the boundary of the positive orthant which correspond to semilocking sets (alternatively called siphons). Consequently, most recent work on persistence of these systems has been focused on these sets. In this paper, we focus on a result which states that, for a conservative mass-action system, persistence holds if every critical semilocking set is dynamically nonemptiable and the system contains no nested locking sets. We will generalize this result by introducing the notion of a weakly dynamically nonemptiable semilocking set and making novel use of the well-known Farkas' lemma. We will also connect this result to known results regarding complex balanced systems and systems with facets.},

	abstract = {The intrinsic, or mitochondrial, pathway of caspase activation is essential for apoptosis induction by various stimuli including cytotoxic stress. It depends on the cellular context, whether cytochrome c released from mitochondria induces caspase activation gradually or in an all-or-none fashion, and whether caspase activation irreversibly commits cells to apoptosis. By analyzing a quantitative kinetic model, we show that inhibition of caspase-3 (Casp3) and Casp9 by inhibitors of apoptosis (IAPs) results in an implicit positive feedback, since cleaved Casp3 augments its own activation by sequestering IAPs away from Casp9. We demonstrate that this positive feedback brings about bistability (i.e., all-or-none behaviour), and that it cooperates with Casp3-mediated feedback cleavage of Casp9 to generate irreversibility in caspase activation. Our calculations also unravel how cell-specific protein expression brings about the observed qualitative differences in caspase activation (gradual versus all-or-none and reversible versus irreversible). Finally, known regulators of the pathway are shown to efficiently shift the apoptotic threshold stimulus, suggesting that the bistable caspase cascade computes multiple inputs into an all-or-none caspase output. As cellular inhibitory proteins (e.g., IAPs) frequently inhibit consecutive intermediates in cellular signaling cascades (e.g., Casp3 and Casp9), the feedback mechanism described in this paper is likely to be a widespread principle on how cells achieve ultrasensitivity, bistability, and irreversibility.},

Here we present a comprehensive dynamic model of the Neurospora crassa circadian clock that incorporates its key components and their transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation. The model accounts for a wide range of clock characteristics including: a periodicity of 21.6 hours, persistent oscillation in constant conditions, arrhythmicity in constant light, resetting by brief light pulses, and entrainment to full photoperiods. Crucial components influencing the period and amplitude of oscillations were identified by control analysis. Furthermore, simulations enabled us to propose a mechanism for temperature compensation, which is achieved by simultaneously increasing the translation of frq RNA and decreasing the nuclear import of FRQ protein.},

Based on quantitative steady-state and dynamic time course data on signaling intermediaries, normally and in diabetes, we developed a dynamic mathematical model of insulin signaling. The model structure and parameters are identical in the normal and diabetic states of the model, except for three parameters that change in diabetes: (i) reduced concentration of insulin receptor, (ii) reduced concentration of insulin-regulated glucose transporter GLUT4, and (iii) changed feedback from mammalian target of rapamycin in complex with raptor (mTORC1). Modeling reveals that at the core of insulin resistance in human adipocytes is attenuation of a positive feedback from mTORC1 to the insulin receptor substrate-1, which explains reduced sensitivity and signal strength throughout the signaling network. Model simulations with inhibition of mTORC1 are comparable with experimental data on inhibition of mTORC1 using rapamycin in human adipocytes. We demonstrate the potential of the model for identification of drug targets, e.g. increasing the feedback restores insulin signaling, both at the cellular level and, using a multilevel model, at the whole body level. Our findings suggest that insulin resistance in an expanded adipose tissue results from cell growth restriction to prevent cell necrosis.},

	abstract = {Progress in the development of therapeutic interventions to treat or slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease has been hampered by lack of efficacy and unforeseen side effects in human clinical trials. This setback highlights the need for new approaches for pre-clinical testing of possible interventions. Systems modelling is becoming increasingly recognised as a valuable tool for investigating molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in ageing and age-related diseases. However, there is still a lack of awareness of modelling approaches in many areas of biomedical research. We previously developed a stochastic computer model to examine some of the key pathways involved in the aggregation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) and the micro-tubular binding protein tau. Here we show how we extended this model to include the main processes involved in passive and active immunisation against Aβ and then demonstrate the effects of this intervention on soluble Aβ, plaques, phosphorylated tau and tangles. The model predicts that immunisation leads to clearance of plaques but only results in small reductions in levels of soluble Aβ, phosphorylated tau and tangles. The behaviour of this model is supported by neuropathological observations in Alzheimer patients immunised against Aβ. Since, soluble Aβ, phosphorylated tau and tangles more closely correlate with cognitive decline than plaques, our model suggests that immunotherapy against Aβ may not be effective unless it is performed very early in the disease process or combined with other therapies.},

  abstract  = {Recently, symbolic computation and computer algebra systems have been successfully applied in systems biology, especially in chemical reaction network theory. One advantage of symbolic computation is its potential for qualitative answers to biological questions. Qualitative methods analyze dynamical input systems as formal objects, in contrast to investigating only part of the state space, as is the case with numerical simulation. However, corresponding tools and libraries have a different set of requirements for their input data than their numerical counterparts. A common format used in mathematical modeling of biological processes is Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML). We illustrate that the use of SBML data in symbolic computation requires significant pre-processing, incorporating external biological and mathematical expertise. ODEbase provides suitable input data derived from established existing biomodels, covering in particular the BioModels database. ODEbase is available free of charge at https://odebase.org.},

    abstract = {In life sciences, deriving insights from dynamic models can be challenging due to the large number of state variables involved. To address this, model reduction techniques can be used to project the system onto a lower-dimensional state space. Constrained lumping can reduce systems of ordinary differential equations with polynomial derivatives up to linear combinations of the original variables while preserving specific output variables of interest. Exact reductions may be too restrictive in practice for biological systems since quantitative information is often uncertain or subject to estimations and measurement errors. This might come at the cost of limiting the actual aggregation power of exact reduction techniques. We propose an extension of exact constrained lumping which relaxes the exactness requirements up to a given tolerance parameter \$\${\textbackslash}varepsilon \$\$ε. We prove that the accuracy, i.e., the difference between the output variables in the original and reduced model, is in the order of \$\${\textbackslash}varepsilon \$\$ε. Furthermore, we provide a heuristic algorithm to find the smallest \$\${\textbackslash}varepsilon \$\$εfor a given maximal approximation error. Finally, we demonstrate the approach in biological models from the literature by providing coarser aggregations than exact lumping while accurately capturing the original system dynamics.},
