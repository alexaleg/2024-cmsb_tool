We extended CLUE\cite{ovchinnikov_clue_2021,jimenez_clue_2022} to include approximate lumping.
This method increases the aggregation power of lumping relaxing the aggregation criteria.
Moreover, we have introduced simulation functionalities which allow for exploration of different reductions of a given model.
Further work will extend the functionalities of CLUE to include analytic functions and extended support to interface with other formats such as \texttt{SMBL} and libraries such as BioNetGen.
