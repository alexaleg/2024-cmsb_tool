We extended CLUE\cite{ovchinnikov_clue_2021,jimenez_clue_2022} to support approximate reductions.
This method increases the aggregation power of lumping by relaxing the aggregation criteria.
Moreover, we have introduced simulation functionalities which allow for the exploration of different model reductions.
Further work will extend the functionalities of CLUE to include analytic functions and other formats such as \texttt{SMBL} and libraries such as BioNetGen.
